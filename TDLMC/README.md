# TDLMC analysis
This repository hosts the Time-Delay lens modeling challenge rung3 validation based on the submission from the EPFL team by Aymeric Galan and Martin Millon.


The jupyter notebookTDLMC_rung3_inference.ipynb processes the indificual constraint in a common format and performs the hierarchical analysis. The pre-processings are saved in a pickle file.

The file tdlmc_rung3_posterior_table.csv consists of the table with the meta-information and 1-d marginalized posteriors fo the relevant lens model parameters.

The blinded analysis is in the folder final_powerlaw_Dd-Ddt_

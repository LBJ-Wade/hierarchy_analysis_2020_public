# MST impact
This repository hosts jupyter notebooks that investigate the impact of the MST on the cosmographic analysis.

The notebook MST_pl_cored.ipynb investigates a power-law profile with an additional cored component as an approximation of the MST.

The notebook MST_composite_cored.ipynb infestigates a star (Hernquist) + dark matter (NFW) profile with an additional cored component as an approximation of the MST.

The notebook anisotropy_ifu.ipynb illustrates the impact of different anisotropy models and the MST in light of the mass-anisotropy degeneracy.

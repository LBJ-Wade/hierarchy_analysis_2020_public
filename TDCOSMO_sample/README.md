# TDCOSMO sample
This repository hosts the individual lens posteriors and the analysis scripts to perform a joint hierarchical analysis of the TDCOSMO sample.

The jupyter notebook tdcosmo_sample.ipynb processes the indificual constraint in a common format and performs the analysis. The pre-processings are saved in pickle files.

The file tdcosmo_sample.csv consists of the table with the meta-information and 1-d marginalized posteriors fo the relevant lens model parameters.

The folder TDCOSMO_data consists the individual lens model posteriors of the 7 TDCOSMO lenses, each in a separate folder.

If you are using products of this folder, please cite the appropriate papers where these products are derived.
